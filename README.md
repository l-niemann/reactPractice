# Sample App
This is an app I use to practice writing React.
Currently there are 5 apps: `Calculator`, `Restaurant`, `Cipher`, `Jumping Game`, and `Todo List`.

# Calculator.
This app is a simple calculator that can do basic operations with
parentheses

Has two different ciphers that can be used to encrypt an input: Caesar and Vigenére.

# Jumping Game
This is a game where you jump over blocks as they come towards you like the google dinosaur game.

# Todo List
Simple todo list where you can add/remove sections and items.

# Styled Components Practice
