# Sample App
This is an app I use to practice writing React.
Currently there are 4 apps: `Calculator`, `Restaurant`, `Cipher`, and `Jumping Game`.

# Calculator
This app is a simple calculator that can do basic operations with
parentheses

# Restaurant
This is a mockup for a restaurant it has the ability to "place" an order

# Cipher
Has two different ciphers that can be used to encrypt an input: Caesar and Vigenére.

# Jumping Game
This is a game where you jump over blocks as they come towards you like the google dinosaur game.
