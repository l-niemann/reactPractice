# Sample App
This is an app I use to practice writing React.
Currently there are 3 apps: `Calculator`, `Restaurant`, and `Cipher`.

# Calculator
This app is a simple calculator that can do basic operations with
parentheses

# Restaurant
This is a mockup for a restaurant it has the ability to "place" an order

# Cipher
Has two different ciphers that can be used to encrypt an input: Caesar and Vigen√©re.
